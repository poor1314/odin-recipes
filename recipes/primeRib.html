        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>

        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
